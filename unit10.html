  <h2>Project Title and Research Question</h2>
    <p>I fully agree with your analysis of the Coraz√≥n case and the importance of ethical considerations in the development and use of technology. In addition to the CEPC principles and BCS Code of Conduct, there are other frameworks and theories that can be applied to help ethical decision-making in technology. For example, the responsible research and innovation (RRI) emphasises the importance of involving stakeholders, considering societal effects, and anticipating possible unintended consequences of technology (Silva et al, 2018).The proposed project title is:  A Comparative Analysis of Cloud Risk Management Frameworks in the Financial Services Industry. Therefor the Research Questions the project will aim to answer are the following: Firstly, what are the different cloud risk management frameworks adopted by financial services companies and secondly how effective are they in managing cloud-related risks?</p>

	<h2>Research Problem</h2>

    <p>With the increasing adoption of cloud technology by financial services companies, there is a need for effective risk management frameworks to address the associated risks. The goal of cloud risk management is identification and recognition of risk at an early stage and then actively changing the course of actions to mitigate and reduce the cloud computing risk (Elzamly et al., 2016).
		However, there is a lack of consensus on the most effective cloud risk management frameworks. The objective of this project is to investigate how companies evaluate essential cloud risks and develop effective internal governance plans to minimize their exposure to such risks in the financial sector.
	   The effectiveness of these frameworks in managing cloud-related risks depends on several factors, including the specific framework adopted, the organization's specific risk profile, and the maturity of its risk management program. It is important for organizations to carefully evaluate the various frameworks and select the one that best fits their needs. Additionally, regular testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of the controls implemented under these frameworks is essential to ensure ongoing effectiveness in managing cloud-related risks. 
	   </p>

	   <h2>Aims and Objectives</h2>

    <p>The main aim of this project is to provide a comparative analysis of the different cloud risk management frameworks adopted by financial services companies. To achieve this aim, the following objectives will be pursued:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>To review and analyse the key literature on cloud risk management frameworks in financial services.</li>
		<li>To identify and evaluate the different cloud risk management frameworks adopted by financial services companies.</li>
		<li>To assess whether or not the cloud deployment model affect which risks are in scope </li>
		<li>To compare the strengths and weaknesses of each framework.</li>
		<li>To provide recommendations for effective cloud risk management in financial services based on the comparative analysis.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Key Literature Related to the Project</h2>
    <p>Financial services companies face unique challenges when it comes to managing cloud-related risks. To address these challenges, many companies have adopted various cloud risk management frameworks. Some of the common frameworks already known are:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM): The CCM is a set of controls that provides a detailed understanding of security concepts and principles that are aligned with the Cloud Security Alliance's 17 domains. This framework provides a roadmap for organizations to assess the security risks of their cloud environment and to identify and implement appropriate controls Cloud Security Alliance (2021).</li>
		<li>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF): The NIST CSF is a framework designed to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risk. The framework consists of five functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover, and provides a comprehensive approach to managing cybersecurity risks (Computer Security Division, 2016).</li>
		<li>International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001: The standard provides a framework for managing risks related to confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, and includes a set of controls that organizations can implement to manage these risks (IT Governance, 2018).</li>
		<li>ICT Guidelines and Internal Governance Guidelines: Created by the European Banking Authority (EBA) These guidelines specify the risk management measures that institutions must take to manage their ICT and security risks for all activities; and that payment service providers (PSPs) must take relating to the payment services they provide (European Banking Authority, 2018).</li>
		<li>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS): The PCI DSS is a set of requirements designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. The standard includes requirements for network security, access control, data protection, and monitoring (PCI Security Standards Council, 2018).</li>
	</ol>

    <p>
		However, although the frameworks exist, literature has highlighted that there is an absence of consistency when it comes to implementing them.  For example according to Anderson-Princen (2022) a complex privacy risk methodology was introduced by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA ) but there is no indication of whether this risk methodology is applied by financial institutions.
		Research to date such as the U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY (2023) has also shown that overall financial services have control gaps indicative of residual risk exposures when it comes to the adoption of cloud technologies. Furthermore, the development of effective internal governance strategies remains challenging, mainly because of the ambiguity surrounding cloud regulations, which creates significant uncertainties. Additionally, compliance is a crucial concern, given the absence of a universally recognized and well-defined cloud risk methodology.
