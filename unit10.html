  <h2>Project Title and Research Question</h2>
    <p>I fully agree with your analysis of the Corazón case and the importance of ethical considerations in the development and use of technology. In addition to the CEPC principles and BCS Code of Conduct, there are other frameworks and theories that can be applied to help ethical decision-making in technology. For example, the responsible research and innovation (RRI) emphasises the importance of involving stakeholders, considering societal effects, and anticipating possible unintended consequences of technology (Silva et al, 2018).The proposed project title is:  A Comparative Analysis of Cloud Risk Management Frameworks in the Financial Services Industry. Therefor the Research Questions the project will aim to answer are the following: Firstly, what are the different cloud risk management frameworks adopted by financial services companies and secondly how effective are they in managing cloud-related risks?</p>

	<h2>Research Problem</h2>

    <p>With the increasing adoption of cloud technology by financial services companies, there is a need for effective risk management frameworks to address the associated risks. The goal of cloud risk management is identification and recognition of risk at an early stage and then actively changing the course of actions to mitigate and reduce the cloud computing risk (Elzamly et al., 2016).
		However, there is a lack of consensus on the most effective cloud risk management frameworks. The objective of this project is to investigate how companies evaluate essential cloud risks and develop effective internal governance plans to minimize their exposure to such risks in the financial sector.
	   The effectiveness of these frameworks in managing cloud-related risks depends on several factors, including the specific framework adopted, the organization's specific risk profile, and the maturity of its risk management program. It is important for organizations to carefully evaluate the various frameworks and select the one that best fits their needs. Additionally, regular testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of the controls implemented under these frameworks is essential to ensure ongoing effectiveness in managing cloud-related risks. 
	   </p>

	   <h2>Aims and Objectives</h2>

    <p>The main aim of this project is to provide a comparative analysis of the different cloud risk management frameworks adopted by financial services companies. To achieve this aim, the following objectives will be pursued:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>To review and analyse the key literature on cloud risk management frameworks in financial services.</li>
		<li>To identify and evaluate the different cloud risk management frameworks adopted by financial services companies.</li>
		<li>To assess whether or not the cloud deployment model affect which risks are in scope </li>
		<li>To compare the strengths and weaknesses of each framework.</li>
		<li>To provide recommendations for effective cloud risk management in financial services based on the comparative analysis.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Key Literature Related to the Project</h2>
    <p>Financial services companies face unique challenges when it comes to managing cloud-related risks. To address these challenges, many companies have adopted various cloud risk management frameworks. Some of the common frameworks already known are:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM): The CCM is a set of controls that provides a detailed understanding of security concepts and principles that are aligned with the Cloud Security Alliance's 17 domains. This framework provides a roadmap for organizations to assess the security risks of their cloud environment and to identify and implement appropriate controls Cloud Security Alliance (2021).</li>
		<li>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF): The NIST CSF is a framework designed to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risk. The framework consists of five functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover, and provides a comprehensive approach to managing cybersecurity risks (Computer Security Division, 2016).</li>
		<li>International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001: The standard provides a framework for managing risks related to confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, and includes a set of controls that organizations can implement to manage these risks (IT Governance, 2018).</li>
		<li>ICT Guidelines and Internal Governance Guidelines: Created by the European Banking Authority (EBA) These guidelines specify the risk management measures that institutions must take to manage their ICT and security risks for all activities; and that payment service providers (PSPs) must take relating to the payment services they provide (European Banking Authority, 2018).</li>
		<li>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS): The PCI DSS is a set of requirements designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. The standard includes requirements for network security, access control, data protection, and monitoring (PCI Security Standards Council, 2018).</li>
	</ol>

    <p>
		However, although the frameworks exist, literature has highlighted that there is an absence of consistency when it comes to implementing them.  For example according to Anderson-Princen (2022) a complex privacy risk methodology was introduced by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA ) but there is no indication of whether this risk methodology is applied by financial institutions.
		Research to date such as the U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY (2023) has also shown that overall financial services have control gaps indicative of residual risk exposures when it comes to the adoption of cloud technologies. Furthermore, the development of effective internal governance strategies remains challenging, mainly because of the ambiguity surrounding cloud regulations, which creates significant uncertainties. Additionally, compliance is a crucial concern, given the absence of a universally recognized and well-defined cloud risk methodology.
	</p>
	<p>Literature has also highlighted the following as the known key risks in this area of study: </p>
	<ol>
		<li>Non-availability of financial resources: The risk of non-availability of financial resources relates to the cloud provider's financial stability, and their ability to continue to operate and provide services if they experience financial difficulties. This could lead to disruptions in service or even the closure of the provider, which could result in data loss or breaches of confidentiality. (Bank of England, 2022)</li>
		<li>Storage of commercially sensitive client data: This risk is related to the storage of sensitive data on the cloud, such as financial data, intellectual property, and confidential client information. Unauthorized access to such data could result in financial loss, reputation damage, and legal liabilities. (Your Europe, 2019)</li>
		<li>
			Complex business processes and architecture: Cloud environments are often highly complex and dynamic, which can make it difficult to manage security effectively. The risk of complex business processes and architecture relates to the potential for security vulnerabilities to be introduced as a result of changes to the cloud environment (Morrow, 2018).
			</li>
			<li>Security: The risk of security breaches is a critical concern in cloud computing. Security risks may arise due to a lack of proper security controls, inadequate authentication mechanisms, or insecure configurations. These risks can result in data loss, theft, and unauthorized access (S. Vinoth et al, 2022).</li>
			<li>Privacy: Cloud services often involve the processing and storage of personal and sensitive information, which makes privacy a significant concern. The risk of privacy breaches relates to the potential for unauthorized access, disclosure, or use of personal information (Your Europe, 2019).</li>
			<li>Legal: The legal risks of cloud computing relate to the contractual arrangements between the cloud provider and the customer. Issues such as liability, indemnification, and jurisdiction can arise, and it is important to ensure that these are addressed in the contract (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 2019).</li>
			<li>Compliance: Many businesses are subject to industry-specific regulations and standards that must be adhered to, even when using cloud services. The risk of non-compliance with these regulations can result in legal and financial penalties, as well as damage to reputation (Meskerem Alemu and Omer, 2015)</li>
			<li>Regulatory issues: Cloud computing is subject to a variety of regulatory requirements, including data protection and privacy regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in legal and financial penalties, as well as reputational damage (Meskerem Alemu and Omer, 2015).</li>
			<li>Migration risk: The risk of migration relates to the potential for data loss, data corruption, or service disruptions during the process of moving applications and data to the cloud. Effective planning and management of the migration process are crucial to mitigate these risks (Maniah et al., 2019).</li>
			<li>Third-party risk: Cloud services often involve the use of third-party providers, such as infrastructure providers or software vendors. The risk of third-party breaches relates to the potential for vulnerabilities in third-party systems or services to be exploited, leading to security or privacy breaches. It is important to ensure that third-party providers are properly vetted and that appropriate security measures are in place. (Anderson-Princen, 2022)</li>
