    <h2>Literature Review </h2>
	<h2>Cloud computing for building effective information systems in Financial Services</h2>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The usage of cloud computing in banking has risen over the last 10 years and the technology has become a significant tool for the operations of banks and financial organisations. The relevance of cloud computing for banks arises from a number of proven benefits that the technology delivers, including greater security, scalability, flexibility, and cost savings (McKinsey & Company, 2020).
		Financial Services is a heavily regulated industry meaning that security and compliance are of upmost importance (Hadjiemmanuil, 2015). In theory, cloud computing allows banks to guarantee that data is kept securely and confidentiality is maintained. Cloud providers invest extensively in cybersecurity by developing advanced security measures that should successfully combat current cyber threats, such as DDoS attacks or ransomware. Similarly Cloud providers offer regular security upgrades, decreasing the pressure on institutions to manage security themselves (Aristi Baquero et al., 2021). Cloud computing also helps banks to access and analyse vast volumes of data in real-time, helping them to make better-informed choices (Diamond, 2020). This review aims to delve deeper into the current understanding of the benefits of cloud computing for building effective information systems whilst also considering the limitations and risks. 
		</p>

		<h2>Key theme 1 – The importance of Scalability and Flexibility </h2>

    <p>One of the key challenges faced by financial institutions especially banks is that they have to balance handling large volumes of data, while keeping up with the ever-changing needs of their customers. Literature around Cloud computing has found that by implementing this technology it will enable banks to extend their IT infrastructure fast and easily, without having to invest in costly new hardware, software, and other infrastructure. Cloud service providers pool together and manage IT resources used to deliver computer infrastructure. Banks can then simply and rapidly assign the resources they require and minimise downtime (McKinsey & Company, 2020). These resources are distributed based on the specific predetermined business use cases meaning that the banks don't have to be concerned with the process of the implementation. The Cloud utilises virtualization technology and enables users to access data and software resources using a basic terminal device without having to worry about where a programme is being executed (Yan, 2017). It seems as though sharing of resources and flexibility of cloud computing are its defining features however some literature such as Carroll, Van Der Merwe and Kotzé (2011) highlight that this model comes with risks especially around data control.  When a company employs cloud computing services, it may have limited control over its data because it is stored on servers managed by the cloud provider. This can make it difficult for businesses to keep control of sensitive data, particularly in the case of a data breach or other security contraventions. Further literature such as Opara-Martins, Sahandi and Tian (2016) explain that although Cloud computing services are supposed to be scalable and customisable, in reality the level of customisation is often limited which makes it challenging for businesses to adapt their cloud services to fit their specific compliance and security requirements. Based on the above, financial services should assess the importance of having a flexible infrastructure which can be modified as banks can utilise this as their requirements change, for example having flexible infrastructure will help accommodate changes and upgrades in banking rules or releasing new products (Wang and Sui, 2020). As technology evolves, businesses must prioritise adaptation to remain competitive and meet client demands. As a result, organisations must invest in a flexible infrastructure in order to thrive in today's dynamic and continuously changing business climate.
</p>

<h2>Key Theme 2 - Effect on Consumers </h2>

    <p>Another theme highlighted by literature when discussing using cloud computing for building effective information systems in Financial Services is the impact it can have on banking consumers both good and bad. 
		One specific example is how the mortgage industry can become more effective by using cloud computing solutions. Due to their unique regulatory environments, new digital challenger lenders and banks are increasing their market share for residential mortgages by using cloud solutions (Thompson, 2022). Digital challenger lenders have more flexibility in responding to demand and can process mortgage applications 20% more quickly without raising lending risk (OECD, 2020). These lenders also charge slightly less than traditional lenders and may anticipate consumer default more accurately than standard credit providers whilst simultaneously eliminating prejudice in the mortgage market as these solutions are built to operate impartially. 
		Literature from authors such as Bartlett et al. (2017) also discovered that cloud-based robo-advisors in the wealth management sector provide significant benefits to consumers. Not only has this technology made investment more accessible to a larger population, but it has also lowered the minimum investment requirements. Furthermore, compared to traditional commercial bank processes, payment and settlement systems have become more efficient and effective thanks to the implementation of cloud computing and other advanced technologies (Wang and Sui, 2020). 
		Due to the success of digital challengers as mentioned above, research has shown that traditional financial institutions are starting to think about converting their old IT systems to cloud computing (Dalal, Dusek and Mohanrangan, 2020). Banks may be able to develop new business models and provide clients with whole new financial services thanks to cloud computing capabilities. 
		When expanding customer offering by employing new IT systems, the simplification of infrastructure maintenance whilst rapidly processing data typically accelerates this process. Cloud computing technologies provides banks more processing power to handle short-term demand spikes. The capacity of cloud computing to store, analyse, process, and mine enormous volumes of data quickly improves the bank's ability to process data. The distributed architecture in cloud computing offers a new way to implement data warehouses that can significantly increase data storage capacity and analysis speed, allowing banks to quickly extract valuable information from massive amounts of data (Yan, 2017). This enables banks to have a simple migration process, with the final output being better services provided for their consumers. Literature agrees that utilising the distributed model that cloud computing provides has its benefits, however other research however has brought forward the importance of considering data location which is a significant factor in several highly regulated businesses. Kurze et al. (2011) explain that certain require industries require data to be stored in specified geographic areas, which may be challenging to accomplish with cloud computing services spread over different regions. Regulatory requirements on data location should be seriously explored as the distributed architecture of cloud computing could pose challenges for storing data in specific geographic areas.
		</p>

		<h2>Key Theme 3 - Cost Benefits </h2>
    <p>A final theme from recent literature in regard to the use of cloud computing solutions in financial services is the cost saving benefits. Woods, (2021) speculated that Cloud computing is more cost-efficient in the long term, as it enables banks to avoid the cost of investing in expensive equipment and upkeep. The cloud computing technology also enables for real-time invoicing, which ensures banks only pay for the resources they utilise (Wang and Sui, 2020). By removing the need to buy new data centres, servers, storage, and network equipment, cloud computing allows banks to save money. When banks implement cloud computing solutions, they do not need IT management and maintenance staff and using infrastructure services offered by cloud providers, small and medium banks can swiftly create their IT systems with affordable IT services. Banks can also have cost savings as they don't have to worry about paying for new hardware which will eventually depreciate. Due to the elimination of high IT costs and the lock-in of IT systems to a particular vendor's proprietary technology, cloud computing lowers the risk associated with IT uses. Also, banks are no longer constrained to only utilise solutions offered by specific hardware manufacturers owing to compatibility requirements thanks to the availability of cloud computing's infrastructure, development platforms and SAAS solutions (Yan, 2017). However, some research such as Brender and Markov (2013) highlight that this dependency on third-party suppliers can pose some risk.  When businesses employ cloud computing services, they become dependent on third-party providers for the storage, processing, and administration of their data. This dependence can cause hazards, such as the potential for service outages, data loss, or data breaches.
	</p>	

	<h2>Final takeaway and areas for future exploration </h2>
    <p>Cloud computing will become a crucial instrument for banks and financial organisations as the banking sector continues to become more digitally oriented. The usage of cloud computing in banking has various benefits, including greater security, scalability, flexibility, and cost savings.  According to the research we have reviewed we can summarise that there are two major security challenges that banks face when implementing cloud computing: information security issues and business security issues. Cloud computing offers benefits such as using less resources, but banks are concerned about dangers of unauthorised access and information breaches when keeping more data in "the cloud." Conventional information security risks such as managing privilege access will still exist in cloud computing, while new security risks develop as a result of its features, therefore many financial executives are hesitant to implement cloud computing without proper security safeguards. Business security concerns include the bank being exposed to potential dangers as a result of cloud providers eventually not having the capacity to satisfy their needs or terminating services due to financial troubles. As the banking sector becomes more complicated, the legitimacy of existing cloud suppliers may be called into question, and the data processing capabilities and risk control of the cloud computing platform may face increased challenges (Balanagalakshmi, 2020). 
		Professionals such as Venkatraman (2012) discuss the lack of industrial standards in cloud computing which may lead to issues in the banking industry, notably in terms of information security and data protection. Cloud computing has new concepts and technological architecture, but the absence of technical standards may produce instability in design and issues in the convergence of systems which may limit the banking industry's commercial expansion. Furthermore, absence of security models and standards in the cloud computing architecture may enable service providers to avoid most security risks and pass them to users, which may expose bank customers' sensitive data. 
		Lines of responsibility when it comes to adhering to compliance regulations is another factor to consider as these regulations must be upheld by all parties involved in managing sensitive data. Cloud computing raises concerns about data security, privacy, and compliance, and businesses need to ensure that their cloud providers meet these regulatory requirements. Effective laws and regulations are important to guarantee information security and quality of service. Yet, legislation and regulatory guidelines on the deployment of cloud computing in the banking sector have not yet been standardized so there may be some concern they current are working on a trust basis with their cloud providers. Due to the aforementioned reasoned can conclude that it is necessary to set proper standards, regulations, and regulatory norms to assure information security, data protection, and high-quality services in cloud computing.
