    <h2>Reflective Exercise Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Survey</h2>
    <p>The Cambridge Analytica incident concerned the unlawful use of Facebook user data for political advertising purposes without users' authorization. The data was taken through a quiz software that captured not only the data of the people who took the quiz but also their friends' data, resulting in the collection of millions of Facebook profiles. This data was then used to develop a psychological profile of voters, which was utilised to influence their voting behaviour during the 2016 US Presidential Election and the Brexit referendum in the UK (Meredith, 2018)</p>

    <p>Another example of unethical usage of surveys is the case of Google and its data collection procedures for its Street View product. In 2010, it was reported that Google has been gathering personal data such as email addresses and passwords using insecure wifi networks while capturing photographs for its Street View program. This resulted in a violation of privacy laws in many countries and a payment of $7 million in the US (Prigg, 2013).
	</p>

    <p>These examples have major ethical, social, legal, and professional ramifications. From an ethical aspect, the use of surveys for alternative purposes contradicts the concept of informed consent, which mandates that individuals offer their consent before their data is collected, processed, or shared. From a sociological aspect, the incorrect use of surveys weakens public faith in the institutions and organisations that are responsible for collecting and using data. From a legal aspect, the inappropriate use of surveys may result in infringement of privacy and data protection regulations, which can lead to legal action and financial penalties. From a professional standpoint, the incorrect use of surveys can affect the reputation and credibility of individuals and organisations that are involved in data gathering and analysis.
	</p>
    <p>In conclusion, the incorrect use of surveys can have substantial ethical, social, legal, and professional ramifications. It is crucial for individuals, organisations, and professionals involved in data collecting and analysis to follow ethical standards, comply with relevant laws and regulations, and prioritise the privacy and informed consent of individuals.</p>
