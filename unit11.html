    <p>I fully agree with your analysis of the Corazón case and the importance of ethical considerations in the development and use of technology. In addition to the CEPC principles and BCS Code of Conduct, there are other frameworks and theories that can be applied to help ethical decision-making in technology. For example, the responsible research and innovation (RRI) emphasises the importance of involving stakeholders, considering societal effects, and anticipating possible unintended consequences of technology (Silva et al, 2018).</p>

    <p>Moreover, the Corazón case shows the need for transparency in technology design and implementation. The use of open bug bounty programs and independent security evaluations, as well as prompt response to possible vulnerabilities, shows a commitment to transparency and accountability. This draws parallels to the idea that explainability in artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important as AI systems are used in decision-making processes that impact people's lives. Explainability requires that AI systems provide clear and understandable descriptions of their decision-making processes (The Royal Society, 2019).</p>

    <p>In conclusion, the Corazón case underscores the importance of ethical factors in technology development and implementation. By applying various frameworks and theories and promoting transparency, explainability, and fairness in technology, computing professionals can help ensure that technology is created and used in a responsible and safe way that benefits society.</p>
