    <h2>Data Collection Exercise  / Questionnaire Review</h2>

    <p>The full survey details can be found here https://cqpi.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/599/2016/07/Pilot_Study_Questionnaire.pdf</p>

    <p>The computer and information security end user questionnaire is designed to collect data on non-malicious CIS deviations by end-users, which may make computer and information systems more vulnerable. The study is being conducted by the Center for Quality and Productivity Improvement at the University of Wisconsin-Madison to understand computer and information security from a human factors perspective. The questionnaire aims to identify examples of end-users' deviations from written and unwritten CIS rules, such as weak passwords, password sharing, and turning off firewalls. The purpose of the questionnaire is to help make computer and information systems less vulnerable by learning more about CIS deviations. The questionnaire should take at most 10 minutes to complete (The University of Wisconsin-Madison, 2008).</p>
    <p>The survey is in a PDF format and is designed to be accessible on line. There is a multiple-choice format with fixed yes/ no answers allowing for easier data analysis. The survey is well organised as it is split into 13 sections. Through reviewing each section we can see that the questions are clearly aligned to the section title. Furthermore, there is continuous guidance throughout the survey leaving minimal room for ambiguity for the survey participants. There is room for improvement as some of the questions did not have an N/A option, there should also be an option for free text to get the most accurate response.</p>
