  <h2>Learning Objective 1</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues that affect computing professionals.</li>
    
   </ul>
    <h2>Privacy Case Study</h2>
	<h2>The Case</h2>
    <p>Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a computer records clerk, where he has access to files of property tax records. For a scientific study, a researcher, Beth, has been granted access to the numerical portion “but not the corresponding names” of some records.</p>

    <p>Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs the names and addresses corresponding with certain properties. Beth asks Ricardo to retrieve these names and addresses, so she can contact these people for more information and for permission to do further study.</p>

	<h2>The Questions </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What are the ethical issues involved in deciding which of these options to pursue?</li>
	<li>If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?</li>
	<li>Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?</li>
	<li>Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records department release individuals' names to a researcher? What are the ethical issues for the Records department to consider?</li>
	<li>Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond giving permission, one-third respond denying permission, and one-third do not respond. Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid study. What options are available to Beth?</li>
    
   </ul>

   <h2>My Response</h2>
   <p>There are several ethical issues involved in this case:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Confidentiality: Ricardo has access to property tax records that contain personal information. Disclosing this information to Beth without proper authorization could be a breach of confidentiality.</li>
	<li>Responsibility: If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, he should not release the names and addresses without proper authorization.?</li>
	<li>Granting access: If Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access, he would need to consider the ethical issues involved in granting access to Beth. He would need to ensure that the release of information is within the scope of the researcher's project and that the privacy of individuals is protected.?</li>
	<li>Consent: The Records department should consider the ethical issues involved in releasing individuals' names to a researcher. They need to ensure that individuals' consent is obtained before their personal information is released.</li>
	<li>Valid study: Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid study. However, the ethical issues involved in such a claim need to be considered, such as the impact on individuals' privacy and the potential harm caused by unwanted solicitation.
	</li>
    
   </ol>

    <p>In summary, the ethical issues involved in this case revolve around confidentiality, responsibility, granting access, consent, and the validity of the study. To resolve these issues, proper authorization and consent need to be obtained, and ethical principles such as privacy and confidentiality should be respected. This case highlights the importance of ethical considerations in handling personal information and conducting research.</p>
