	<h1>Reflective Log</h1>
    <h2>Unit 1 </h2>
    <p>At the beginning of this module, we were tasked with completing our first summative assignment, a mini literature review. We were given a set list of topics to choose from, and I selected "Medical implant risk analysis" (ACM Ethics, 2018). The main reason for my choice was that I had recently completed work on a medical case study as part of the Human Factors module, where we had to create a review of Human Factors when implementing New Technology. I was interested in seeing how I could have used my newfound understanding of ACM guidelines (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018) to develop my critique during that past assignment. Overall, this exercise helped me gain a deeper understanding of the importance of conducting thorough research and analysis, especially when it comes to complex and sensitive issues in the field of technology.</p>

	<h2>Unit 2</h2>

    <p>During this unit, we learned about the process of formulating a literature review. This involves analysing and identifying reliable sources of literature, as well as developing research questions and proposals (University of Southern California, 2014). By doing so, we are able to define the scope, limitations, methodology, and areas that needed focus in relation to the research topic. Looking back, I realize that it would have been beneficial to conduct my peer responses in parallel to my initial post, as it would have allowed me to develop my skills in synthesizing information. Unfortunately, I was late in submitting the peer responses, but I plan to work on this area in the future.
	</p>

	<h2>Unit 3</h2>

    <p>In this unit, we had to create a final response to our initial post. Through this process, I was reminded of the significance of ethical considerations in the development and use of technology. I gained a deeper understanding of the BCS Code of Conduct and its key principles, which I believe will benefit me in my future studies and career. The discussion also highlighted the need for ongoing evaluation and improvement in technology products to ensure they meet ethical standards and address potential vulnerabilities. This was a valuable lesson that will guide me as I continue to work in the technology field.</p>

	<h2>Unit 4</h2>
    <p>During this unit, we were introduced to data collection methods used for qualitative research, and we discussed the advantages and drawbacks of these methods. We also delved into a case study on privacy to determine the ethical issues involved. Through this case study, I learned that the ethical issues involved in handling personal information and conducting research revolve around confidentiality, responsibility, granting access, consent, and the validity of the study. To resolve these issues, proper authorization and consent need to be obtained, and ethical principles such as privacy and confidentiality should be respected. This case highlighted the importance of ethical considerations in handling personal information and conducting research, which is especially relevant in today's data-driven world.</p>

    <h2>Unit 5-6</h2>
    <p>In these units, we explored the use of surveys and interviews as forms of research. We analysed the benefits and drawbacks of each method and discussed how they can be used effectively in research projects. We also looked into the Cambridge Analytica incident, which concerned the unlawful use of Facebook user data for political advertising purposes without users' authorization (Meredith,2018) as well as a Data Collection Exercise/Questionnaire Review. Through these case studies, I learned that the incorrect use of surveys can have substantial ethical, social, legal, and professional ramifications. It is crucial for individuals, organizations, and professionals involved in data collecting and analysis to follow ethical standards, comply with relevant laws and regulations, and prioritize the privacy and informed consent of individuals</p>

	<h2>Unit 7</h2>

    <p>During this unit, we were encouraged to start the second collaborative learning discussion. Although I submitted the initial post, I was unable to complete the peer response and final summary exercise due to conflicting priorities with my full-time job. This is an area I could work on for future development. We also had to submit our literature review and the feedback received for my literature review was fair as it seems the main point for improvement was critically, this is something I am still unsure of how to implement without imposing too much of my own personal opinion as that isn’t necessarily an academic approach.</p>

	<h2>Unit 8-9</h2>

    <p>We were introduced to statistical inference in this unit, which involves drawing conclusions based on the data under investigation. I found the statistical exercises engaging, but formatting exercises took up most of my time. I will spend more time in Excel to improve this.</p>

	<h2>Unit 10-12</h2>
    <p>In this unit, I submitted my research proposal presentation. My proposed area of research is “A Comparative Analysis of Cloud Risk Management Frameworks in the Financial Services Industry”. The Research Questions the project will aim to answer are the following: Firstly, what are the different cloud risk management frameworks adopted by financial services companies and secondly how effective are they in managing cloud-related risks?. Overall, the research proposal helped plan and create a structure as to how the research project would be implemented. Based on the feedback I received, I need to include my citations in the presentation itself and not just the transcript. I also had a look at my professional development plan and from this exercise gathered that in the future, and especially for my capstone project, I need to review additional material and samples of exemplary research to better understand how to satisfy the expectations related to criticality and critical thinking.</p>
	
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Overall, although the module was very time intensive, it was still incredibly informative, emphasizing the importance of ethical research conduct and the use of different research methods to acquire reliable knowledge. This module challenged me to adopt a more academic approach to research, which I believe will improve my research in my employment. I look forward to applying the lessons learned in my Master's capstone project.
