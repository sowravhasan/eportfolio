  <h2>Learning Objective 1</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues that affect computing professionals.</li>
    
   </ul>
    <h2>Discussion 1 - Summary Post</h2>
    <p>In summary, the discussion focused on the ethical considerations surrounding the development and use of technology, using Coraz√≥n, a medical technology start-up as an example. The discussion touched upon several important issues, including the company's commitment to social responsibility, its compliance with regulations, and its approach to addressing potential vulnerabilities. However, concerns were also raised regarding the use of hard-coded values and the potential risks associated with wireless connectivity.</p>

    <p>One key takeaway from this discussion is the importance of conducting thorough risk analysis and considering the long-term implications of technology design choices. It is also essential to adhere to ethical principles and codes of conduct, such as the BCS Code of Conduct, to ensure that technology is developed and used in a responsible and safe manner.</p>

    <p>In terms of my learning journey, this discussion has reinforced the significance of ethical considerations in the development and use of technology. I have gained a deeper understanding of the BCS Code of Conduct and its key principles, which I believe will benefit me in my future studies and career. Additionally, the discussion has highlighted the need for ongoing evaluation and improvement in technology products to ensure they meet ethical standards and address potential vulnerabilities.</p>
